The sign-up process is the first step to enjoy the full benefits of our restaurant app. Follow these steps:

- Open the app and click on the "Sign Up" button.

## 3. OTP Authentication
To enhance the security of your account, we use OTP (One-Time Password) authentication. Here's how to set it up:

- After logging in, go to your account settings.
- Enable OTP authentication.
- A unique OTP will be sent to your registered email or phone number each time you log in.
- Enter the OTP within the specified time to access your account.

## 4. KYC Verification
As part of our commitment to safety and security, we require KYC verification for certain features of our app. Follow these steps:

- In your account settings, find the "KYC Verification" section.
- Provide the required information and documents, such as a valid ID and a recent utility bill.
- Wait for our team to review your KYC submission. This typically takes a short amount of time.
- Once your KYC is approved, you can access advanced features and enjoy a higher level of trust within our app.
